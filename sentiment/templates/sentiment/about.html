        <p>This application is <strong>attempt</strong> to analyze statements (about people, e.g. politicans) in the Russian-language Twitter</p>

        <p>In this project we use next technologies:<p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python 3 + Django (for application)</li>
            <li>scikit-learn (for learning algorythm and training twitter corpus</li>
            <li>Tweepy (for getting tweets)</li>
            <li>Bootstrap 4 (for front-end)</li>
            <li>Chart.js (for charts)</li>    
        </ul>
        <strong>Warning!</strong><p>Sometimes you can see "neutral" results of analysis, it's happend because our
            training corpus was found from Internet. Now we are working on the creation our tweet-corpus.Also, our sample is too "noisy" (because of spam, advertising)</p>
