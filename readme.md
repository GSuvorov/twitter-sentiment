This application is **attempt** to analyze statements (about people, e.g. politicans) in the Russian-language Twitter

In this project used next technologies:

* Python 3 + Django (for application)
* scikit-learn (for learning algorithm and training twitter corpus)
* Tweepy (for getting tweets)
* Bootstrap 4 (for front-end)
* Chart.js (for charts)

### Warning! ###

Sometimes you can see "neutral" results of analysis, it's happend because our training corpus was found from Internet. Now we are working on the creation our tweet-corpus. Also, our sample is too "noisy" (because of spam, advertising)
